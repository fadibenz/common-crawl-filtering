# Data (Inspired from CS336 Assignment 4)

## Setup

This directory is organized as follows:

- [`./tarnsformer_training`](./tarnsformer_training): contains a module
  `transformer-implementation` and its associated `pyproject.toml`. This module contains an 
  implementation of a language model. It also contains scripts this training code
  to train an LM on filtered data. 
- [`./data_filtering`](./data_filtering): This is the module where I will implement code to filter and process the data.


I will use `uv` to manage dependencies.

## Tests

All tests are taken from CS336 assignment 4 public repository.
